    "content": "Blow-Fill-Seal is the better alternative to conventional packaging like glass. That is because Blow-Fill-Seal lets you produce, fill and seal unbreakable plastic packaging fully automatically in a single operation. 100% aseptic and with the greatest possible flexibility in container design. Compact, environmentally friendly and without any complex processes.",
